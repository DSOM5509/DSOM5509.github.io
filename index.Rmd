### Course Description

#### About RDTT IV

*Learn from your data, but your data should not be your teacher.* ~ Rex Kline

In this course we cover structural equation modeling and multilevel modeling through [frequentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference) and [Bayesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) perspectives.  This is the forth Research Design and Theory Testing foundations course, and I do not use the word ‘foundation’ lightly.  What we do in this course will provide the essential and necessary elements for your future success as a doctoral student and faculty member.  It will be fun (promise!), challenging, frustrating (also promise!), complex, and should challenge your self-efficacy.  If you feel all of these emotions over the course of the term, we achieved our goal.

#### Course Purpose

*The data may not contain the answer. The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data.* ~ John Tukey

This is not a typical research design---or applied statistics for that matter---course.  Often in doctoral programs, you would take a course on design, and then a separate course on univariate/multivariate statistics.  As a doctoral student myself, I struggled under this format to make the connections between design and empirics---not knowing which test went with what design, how to interpret model results as you would in a paper, and so forth.  This course approaches these foundational skills differently.

Roughly each week, we will have a content class, and a lab session (both of which are required by the way!).  You will be reading papers, conducting analyses, and engaging in classroom discussions where the design question at hand pairs with the type of analytical work most appropriate to test the data resulting from this design.  For example, when we cover lab-based experiments, we will be learning and interpreting ANOVA models.  The intent is to minimize the gap between design and empirics, and to set you on a path of incorporating empirical considerations into your research designs before you start collecting data.  Ultimately, we are a quantitative behavioral science.  To be successful in our field---even if you pursue substantially qualitative work in your later career---requires comfort, confidence, and capability with quantitative research design and data analysis.

It is also important to manage your expectations for this course.  This course provides a deep understanding of core research design and applied statistics material---the basics, if you will.  Understanding these basics will make it much easier to learn more advanced design and statistical topics as you develop as a scholar.  But this journey is a marathon, not a sprint.  You shouldn’t look at this course with the intention to ‘master’ these topical areas; this is your first step, and knowledge is sticky.  Think about this course as starting construction on your methods ‘reference library’ that you will add to---and progressively understand better---as you advance through your doctoral studies.

#### Class Format

This is not a traditional lecture-based course. I use a modified version of the ‘flipped classroom’ format, which means that you will read blog posts, academic papers, watch a video before each period, and complete an assessment exercise. During class we will focus on solving a problem or problems using exercises, team activities, additional assessments, and an open discussion. Success in this course is a function of your engagement. I cannot stress this point enough--you must engage with the material and with your peers. Data science is a contact sport---you must come to each and every class prepared and ready to contribute!

### Assessment

#### Assessment Breakdown

* Attendance & Participation: 30%
* Lab Exercises: 20%
* Study Preregistration: 50%

#### Attendance & Participation

From a pedagogical perspective, we maximize student comprehension when we combine reading materials, performing experiential activities, and discussion with peers.  Readings are a required element for classroom participation, and experiential activities happen in the lab and through the large proposal project.  That means discussion is our third critical assessment mechanism, and it takes your active involvement, preparation, and participation to add value to all of us.  This is not, however, an MBA class where you are competing for ‘airtime.’  We are scholars and scientists, and discussion is an important way in which we communicate and improve our work.  My expectation is that you will meaningfully contribute to each class session by engaging in our conversations and by asking--and answering--questions.  Yes, I will cold-call if you are not meeting this expectation.  The easiest way to lose points is to be demonstrably unprepared or to behave in a rude, unprofessional manner.  I have every expectation however that you will earn the maximum points available for this assessment.  

#### Lab Exercises

During most lab sessions, we will have a brief assessment exercise.  Most often these will be completion exercises that you finish during that session, and that we will debrief that day.  

#### Study Pregistration

The main deliverable in the class will be a study preregistration, accompanied by any necessary [UMKC Institutional Review Board](http://ors.umkc.edu/research-compliance-(iacuc-ibc-irb-rsc)/institutional-review-board-(irb)) approval. We will cover the specific deliverable requirements in a Lab Session on 8 Feb, and please see the course schedule for deliverable due-dates.
